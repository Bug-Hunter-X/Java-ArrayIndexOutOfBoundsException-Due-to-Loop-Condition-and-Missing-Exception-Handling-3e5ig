This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by an incorrect loop condition and lack of exception handling. The `BuggyJavaCode.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `CorrectedJavaCode.java` shows how to fix it using proper loop conditions and a try-catch block to handle the exception gracefully.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing and robust exception management in Java development.
